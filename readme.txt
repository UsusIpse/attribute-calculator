Multiply price by definable product attribute

== Description ==

Multiply price by definable product attribute

== Installation ==

After activation you will have a new submenu under Plugins. Follow that to enable and set your attribute name.
Make sure you have an attribute with a number and you are good to go. 
This is designed to work with the attribute slug from Woo. So if you call your attribute 1 Foot, then the slug:
1-foot will equal 1
but
1foot will return a non value, so don't mess with the slugs unless you know what you are doing
